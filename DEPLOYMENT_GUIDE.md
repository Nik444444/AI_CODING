```bash
# Push to GitHub first
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Emergent Clone"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/emergent-clone.git
git push -u origin main

# Then connect to Netlify:
# 1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
# 2. "New site from Git" → Choose GitHub → Select repo
# 3. Build settings:
#    - Base directory: frontend
#    - Build command: npm run build  
#    - Publish directory: frontend/build
# 4. Environment variables:
#    - REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL = https://your-backend-app.fly.dev
```

**Option B: Manual Upload**
```bash
cd frontend
export REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-app.fly.dev
npm run build
# Drag & drop 'build' folder to Netlify dashboard
```
